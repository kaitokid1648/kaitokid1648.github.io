I am PhD student jointly advised by Prof. [Anima Anandkumar](http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/) and Prof. [Babak Hassibi](https://www.babak.caltech.edu/) in the [CMS department](http://cms.caltech.edu/) at [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/). My primary research interests are in Machnine Learning, Information Theory and High Dimensional Statistics.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically. -->

Prior to my PhD, I completed my undergraduate studies in the Department of Electrical Engineering at <a href="https://www.iitm.ac.in/">IIT Madras</a>.
